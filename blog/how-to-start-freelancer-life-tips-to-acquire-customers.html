            <div class="blog-subhead">
                I work as a full time online marketing specialist. I love it, but to be honest, it doesn’t give me
                enough.
                That’s why I started learning front-end development a year ago and winking at “freelancing”.
            </div>
            <div class="blog-blog">
                <p>
                    My goal isn’t necessarily to change my entire career, as I have many years of experience behind me,
                    that I wouldn’t throw in the trash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is missing from marketing, however, is the "skilled" part. To create something, that has a
                    finished end result, that I can show someone that
                </p>
                <p class="center bulletpoint">
                    <i>"Look, I did this, so and so ..."</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I already have a lot of these in my portfolio, which I really enjoy: <a href="sollabong.com"

                </p>
                <p>
                    The point is, for the time being, I wink at “freelance” next to full-time, and then we’ll see if it
                    turns out I choose total “freedom”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve read a lot on the subject and talked to a lot of people about it, so now I’ll share with you a
                    few tips, that might come in handy, if you choose the <strong>freelancer</strong> path:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="bulletpoint">
                    <strong>1. Find your market</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the hardest things about working as a freelancer is finding the balance between what you love
                    to do and what you get paid for. Be sure to keep this in mind when you get started.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="bulletpoint">
                    <strong>2. Start building your portfolio</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you listen to me, in addition to your current job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It takes time to build a freelancer job. The first period is to prepare, for which you need to
                    complete the following tasks:
                </p>
                <div class="bullets">
                    <p>

                    Not a little departure, right? Therefore, I recommend that you try to work full time for the first
                    1-2 years and build your freelance career as a subsidiary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lots of work, but in the long run, it’s worth it if you are looking for "freedom".

                </p>
                <p>
                    Finding the first few customers is hard, VERY MUCH. Here are some creative ways you can find them:
                </p>
                <div class="bullets">
                    <p>

                        and apply
                        for
                        them. Yes, at first it doesn’t
                        seem logical, since that’s exactly what you want to get rid of the squirrel wheel.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If everything goes well, they even offer you a job, ask them to work for them at project level.
                        You
                        build
                        your portfolio, you can stay independent and keep working if they like this construction too.
                    </p>

                        <i class="fas coloring fa-check"></i> By the same logic, you can visit agencies that work for
                        big brands.
                        These jobs will show up pretty well in your portfolio, believe me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i class="fas coloring fa-check"></i> Look around next door. Are there people in your circle of
                        acquaintances
                        for whom you would create a website?<br>
                        Go up to Google Maps. See what businesses / shops are in your area. Make them an offer to pimp
                        their
                        site.
                        Did you know that nearly 60% of websites are not optimized for mobile at all? Make theirs
                        optimized.

                    If you’re lucky, or you’re negotiating skillfully, you can start making money right away, but if
                    you’re doing it as a favor to build your portfolio, the most important thing is:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="center">

                <p class="bulletpoint">
                    <strong>4. How do you price yourself?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well that's probably one of the hardest parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Dare I ask a lot or do I take down the prices, just choose me?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    NEVER underestimate yourself. It will be very difficult to get out of this trap and your profession
                    will be devalued as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re the cheapest, you might think it’s because you don’t work well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your goal is to earn better, so why work more for less?

                    Everywhere you were expected to: follow the rules and adapt. However, as a freelancer, you are given
                    the freedom to say <b>NO</b>.

                    These are magic words that are a must use if you want to be a successful freelancer.

                    Perhaps most importantly, if you choose this path:
